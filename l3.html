    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">In general, math courses are
        divided by entry-level, upper and graduate levels. Math courses at colleges and universities are intended to
        satisfy basic general education requirements for undergraduates and also provide the math major with advanced
        practice and knowledge in all areas of mathematics. Math majors can choose a concentration area, such as math
        education, applied math and general math. There are also minors in math. </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">Here is an overview of math
        concepts covered at the undergraduate and graduate level for math- and non-math majors: </p>
