    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">In computer science, a data
        structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
        More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions
        or operations that can be applied to the data.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">Data structures serve as the
        basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure
        implements the physical form of the data type.

        Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly
        specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,
        while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers</p>
