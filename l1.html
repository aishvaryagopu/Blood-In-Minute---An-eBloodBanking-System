    <br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on&nbsp;conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer <a href="https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/program">program</a>&nbsp;can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.The word algorithm derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850. Al-Khwarizmi's work is the likely source for the word algebra as well.</p>
