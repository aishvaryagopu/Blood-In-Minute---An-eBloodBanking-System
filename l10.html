    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">Functional programming is a
        programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a
        declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style
        where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to
        produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. Those functions have some special features
        discussed below.</p>
