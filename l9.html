    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">A Shell provides you with an
        interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a
        program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

        Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different
        flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own
        set of recognized commands and functions.</p>
