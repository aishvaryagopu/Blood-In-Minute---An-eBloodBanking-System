      <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">Database is a systematic
        collection of data. Databases support storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy.
        Let's discuss few examples.

        An online telephone directory would definitely use database to store data pertaining to people, phone numbers,
        other contact details, etc.

        Your electricity service provider is obviously using a database to manage billing , client related issues, to
        handle fault data, etc.

        Let's also consider the facebook. It needs to store, manipulate and present data related to members, their
        friends, member activities, messages, advertisements and lot more. </p>
