    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">Ruby is a dynamic, reflective,
        object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Ruby is a pure Object-Oriented language developed by
        Yukihiro Matsumoto. Everything in Ruby is an object except the blocks but there are replacements too for it i.e
        procs and lambda. The objective of Rubyâ€™s development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human
        programmers and the underlying computing machinery.</p>
