      <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:white">SQL stands for Structured Query
        Language, a language for manipulating and talking about data in databases. It first came into use in 1970 and
        became a standard in 1986 by IBM in conjunction with several projects for the US government and for many years
        it remained a government-only project. Itâ€™s a programing language which is used to access data stored in a
        database. </p>
